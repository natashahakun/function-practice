## JavaScript - Functions

### Description

Today we talked about functions in JavaScript -- code blocks that can be executed on-demand, which accept parameters and perform tasks on or with them.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand JavaScript functions - definition, invocation, parameters, and returns
* Understand the principle of DRY
* Be comfortable with a standard TDD workflow
* Have practiced some algorithmic thinking

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* JavaScript functions
* Test-Driven development
* node.js and Express to run a simple web server

## Details

This assignment consists of a simple test runner that's performing tests on functions that we need to complete.

## Normal Mode

Complete the six functions in `public/max.js`, `public/power.js`, and `public/average.js` so that all tests (which are defined in the `public/test` folder) pass.

The first function in each file should be somewhat straightforward. The second function in each file **must** utilize the first function.

**Note**: Please create a git commit after every function's tests are passing for the first time.

## Hard Mode

In additional to normal mode...

1. Complete the four functions in `public/vowel.js` and `public/reverse.js` so that all tests pass. Same as before, the first function in each file should be utilized by the second function.

2. Write up another two-tiered set of functions, and write a similar suite of tests for them.
